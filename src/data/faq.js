    question: "Are these problems enough to crack placements?",
    answer:
      "The problems we’ve included are some of the classic problems in that topic. However, these problems do not cover all the possible questions that could be asked and are meant to be a starting point for your journey in DSA.",
  },
  {
    question: "What language can I use?",
    answer: "Language is not important, solving the problem is!",
  },
  {
    question:
      "I’m not familiar with DSA, can I still try to solve these problems?",
    answer:
      "Yes, this can be your chance to get started! Make sure to check out the resources and explore more on your own. Remember that practice is the key.",
  },
  {
    question: "I’ve gone through all the entries, what next?",
    answer:
      "We recommend exploring more problems in LeetCode and getting familiar with these data structures. Problem solving can be a fun (and very useful) way to put your coding and logic skills to use!",
